# 👋 About Me

I am a **PhD candidate** at the *Rochester Institute of Technology*, where I am advised by [**Dr. Matthew Wright**](https://www.rit.edu/directory/mkwics-matthew-wright). My research lies at the intersection of **cybersecurity**, **privacy**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on applying advanced AI techniques to:

- 🔍 **Network Traffic Analysis**
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Website Fingerprinting**
- 🔗 **Flow Correlation Attacks**

My work explores both **offensive** and **defensive** strategies to address privacy vulnerabilities in modern anonymity networks like **Tor**.

In addition to website fingerprinting and traffic correlation, I have experience in areas such as:

- 🤖 **Adversarial Machine Learning**
- 🚨 **Intrusion Detection**
- 🔒 **Data-Driven Privacy Defenses**
